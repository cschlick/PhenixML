PhenixML
===========================================================================

PhenixML is a project built to support the `Phenix <https://phenix-online.org>`_ suite of tools for 
sturcture refinement of x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM models. Many aspects
of Phenix could benefit from regression/classification tasks on molecules
and molecular fragments. This fragmework aims to make these tasks easy.
